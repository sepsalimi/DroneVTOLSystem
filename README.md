# DroneVTOLSystem
For our UofAlberta Capstone, we:

• Designed and Solid modelled a newly improved Vertical Take-off and Landing system for Pegasus Imagery Ltd.’s Hyperion 
surveillance drone, achieving 37% reduced drag, $4000 under budget spending, and 13% weight reduction 

• Reduced weight and cost using ANSYS Static Structural topology optimization, achieving the highest optimal wing beam 
geometry with a maximum deflection of only 1.8 mm
